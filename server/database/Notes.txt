Suggestions for the coding of the project:

1.) Instead of a Restrict Function, I suggest doing Conditional Rendering which uses more of the items based stored on the database
2.) We (database team) think that the user interface in the erd is not entirely needed due to it being statically loaded na into the program by react
we only need to include data which is changing if ever within the erd.
